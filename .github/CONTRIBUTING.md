## How to contribute to Vanilla Reimplementation

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* Ensure that the associated system is implemented first. E.g. Don't report entities not spawning from spawners, if the
  spawner logic has not been implemented.

* Open a new GitHub issue if it's not already reported.

* Explain it clearly, with steps (or code) to reproduce it.

#### **Did you write some code that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull-request with the commits if it hasn't already been proposed.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open a pull-request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change from a maintainer.
  You can do this in the [minestom discord](https://discord.gg/pkFRvqB).

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the code in the associated discord channel.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Minestom documentation?**

* Feel free to do so! Just make sure to conform to the [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
  specification when editing the README.md.
